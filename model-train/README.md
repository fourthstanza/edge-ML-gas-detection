## This is a set of python scripts for training and optimizing Keras/tflite models.

---

I've put these together to simplify my workflow training models and processing them through Edge Impulse for deployment on microcontrollers.

### Before running, you'll need

* **Python version 3.11** (tested, will likely work fine with other releases)
* **The Keras library** with `pip install keras`
